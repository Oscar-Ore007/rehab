#Rehab

This project is built using the MERN stack: 
  -  MongoDB, Express, React, Node

Rehab is an application that is built for patients who are recovering from various/previous injuries. Rehab provides exercises and videos for patients to follow to recover and maintain their active lifestyle! This was inspired by my most recent injury and road to recovery from an ACL injury. 

More to come soon! 

Adding a Mockup of the Application and illustration of the "user's progression" through the app: https://www.figma.com/file/pA8T4N6lxj4GM4rijXYgVu/Rehab-App?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=5lwhNBLUJbycB1j6-0
